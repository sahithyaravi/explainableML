Of course, I stopped dealing with other lenders who had made offers. I then entered into a months-long process of responding to multiple requests for documentation; everything had been clearly spelled out in my application, but they needed corroboration. Whenever I sent something, they would call a few days later and say that \"Underwriting\" required something else; and that it was all on account of the new govt. regulations. (And note that I was looking to consolidate the 1st and 2d mortgages on my home, and that the total I was asking for was less than 25% of my home's value.)\r\n\r\nFinally, I received a call from my loan contact saying that my credit card balance was too high, and they couldn't give me a loan unless I paid it off first. This was information they had had all along, before they \"pre-approved\" me. In fact, my primary reason for re-financing was to get my monthly mortgage payments lower and to pay off that credit card balance. I basically said that their response was not acceptable; and we eventually got it done. However, I would never recommend them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would give them high points for is responsiveness. At least until I agreed to go with them, they got back to me quicker than anyone. I didn't go with 2 other lenders who were offering similar rates because they weren't getting back to me as fast as Gauranteed Rate. Once I went with them, however, the process dragged on for months; and they almost weren't going to give me the loan. Buyers Beware... Read More\r\n        ",

Fine, but then they wanted copies of my tax returns so they could compare. Since when are they tax auditors? Unable to find the copy for 2011, I had the IRS send us the transcript of it, and sent it via PO, and electronically. But then it was held up for 3 weeks because the transcript was mailed by us, and not the IRS. Now we are getting ridiculous. So we had the IRS fax it to them directly, AND STILL they had a problem with it's \"authenticity\". They received everything we had, with no discrepancies, yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and \"dummy up\" a copy, as long as it would match exactly. We said no, the two separate transcripts were accurate, and they could use those, or we would walk. Amazing that a week later they finally approved it. This guy had emailed and called every day, sometimes as many as 4 times, even during our Christmas trip to Dallas, only to sit and wait, and wonder what the black hole was doing. And to make it more annoying, he had a demeaning way of speaking, saying \"Does that make sense?\", after every statement, as if I couldn't understand basic English. One of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior. They requested the 4506T 4 more times, so we sent them at least 8 to make sure. So that didn't \"make sense\", nor did their inability to accept the IRS transcripts sent from the IRS, nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in Dallas over Christmas. I certainly would not want my friends to feel my frustration... Read More\r\n        "

I had to wait for 9 (nine) weeks to close.\r\n\r\nIt was my luck that his vacation week was in the middle of my process.\r\n\r\nIf NASB needs a document they will wait until the last minute and then come back \"oh we need this document or else we can't continue\"\r\nWhen you have that one taken care of, they will wait \"a week or so\" to get back to you and next week you will hear \"it turns out we also need this document\"\r\nThis went on and on, the day before the closing they would email me and say \"we just noticed that we didn't have your employment verification done\", hours before closing,\r\n\"oh we just found out that we don't have your home insurance verification and we can't reach them\"\r\nI called the insurance company and in ten minutes it was taken care of.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many times I had to hear \"this should be OK\" and turns out it is not OK.\r\n\r\nMany many times they assured me they have all the information they need - but this was never the case.\r\n\r\nThey were not very careful, they missed out all the details, they wasted weeks and weeks because they were not able to go through a check list and see if they have taken care of everything.\r\n\r\nThey always say \"we are too busy with a lot of applications\". I believe they shouln't accept applications that they can't process.\r\n\r\nSample communication:\r\n\r\nme: Why am I being charged for such and such?\r\nrespond: We are not charging you for that.\r\nme: Please check the final HUD line XX\r\nrespond: Sorry I didn't go down that far.\r\nme: ???\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite quotes from them:\r\n\"Sorry! Don't come across this too often. \"\r\n\"Wasn't aware of that...\"\r\n\"This should work.\"\r\n\"Can you possibly call them again? We need it ASAP.\"\r\n\"Thank you for your patience.\"\r\n\"TGIF!\" --(I had to hear this 8-9 times)\r\n\r\nThey are not bad people, but you need a lot of patience dealing with them.\r\n\r\nDo I suggest working with them?\r\nOnly if you are not under any time pressure.\r\nOnly if you can work hard for your own application.\r\nOnly if you have a lot of patience.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel like NASB is an OK bank to work with.

I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation...

          "\r\nPositive: Completed mortgage refinance reducing my APR from 5.25% to 3.5%\r\n\r\nHowever: The 3.5% rate was available at several competitors, several of whom offered lower fees. I was also refinancing to reinstate my VA Certificate of Eligibility toward purchase of a home. Since the rate was available elsewhere, I hired GR based on the broker's claim that the transaction could be completed within 4-5 weeks or less. I formally began the process with Guaranteed Rate on July 2. Based on broker feedback that the transaction was in underwriting on July 23rd, we planned the closing date on our new home purchase for 1 month later and I alerted VA. This refinance didn't close with GR until a full month later (Aug 23) and the loan was funded on Aug 27. I came within 2 days of missing a rate-lock date on the other new-home purchase mortgage because of this.\r\n\r\nCommunications from the broker was horrible. As I mentioned, in parallel with this effort, I was going through the process of obtaining a home purchase mortgage from another company, so I have a great basis of comparison. I received no information from Guaranteed Rate without having to ask for it. When I did receive information, it was minimal (typically \"yes\" or \"no\" answer), so I had to follow-up with additional questions to get clarification on details (I don't do this for a living, that's why I hired GR! I definitely did NOT receive my money's worth).\r\n\r\nIf I'm to believe the broker, my loan package spent 4 1/2 weeks in underwriting. BTW, my credit scores are all above 770, so there was no issue there. When asked, the broker never offered any rationale for the delay.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by GR, I sent this same review two weeks ago.

I thought I had good rate until I spoke with him and we were able to lower it almost a full 1% which saved us hundreds of dollars per month and then he was able to get everything approved/closed on a very tight timeline of less than 4 weeks!

          "\r\nThey increased my rate, quoted me different closing costs 5 different times, took 2 months to get to closing, and needed information that should not have mattered in the least.\r\n        ",
          "\r\nThe Interest rate offered and time to close being short sold us on the loan so we pursued it despite -\r\n1. the fact that a credit check and underwriting was made when per VA rules for an IRRRL these were not necessary and we were assured by Mr. Owens when first discussing the refinancing they would not be made. \r\n2. the constant errors in the paperwork. One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds. Another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in December just a month later during the time NASB intended to sell the mortgage. Thankfully this was corrected by the Closing Agent.\r\n3. Mr. Owens not being straight with us about NASB's intent to sell the mortgage after closing. His statements of first saying NASB would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the Loan Estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there \"just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future.\" Since today, just 5 days after disbursement, I find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows Mr. Owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn't definite. \r\n4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial Closing Document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior to arrival at the Closing Agent's place of business.\r\nPros allow for the Neutral instead of bad rating because the \"despites\" show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable.\r\n...

Anythony is so savvy, financially creative, thoughtful, and thorough that I chose to work with him and DLJ versus any other company.

But then it was held up for 3 weeks because the transcript was mailed by us, and not the IRS. Now we are getting ridiculous. So we had the IRS fax it to them directly, AND STILL they had a problem with it's \\\"authenticity\\\". They received everything we had, with no discrepancies, yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and \\\"dummy up\\\" a copy, as long as it would match exactly. We said no, the two separate transcripts were accurate, and they could use those, or we would walk. Amazing that a week later they finally approved it. This guy had emailed and called every day, sometimes as many as 4 times, even during our Christmas trip to Dallas, only to sit and wait, and wonder what the black hole was doing. And to make it more annoying, he had a demeaning way of speaking, saying \\\"Does that make sense?\\\", after every statement, as if I couldn't understand basic English. One of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior. They requested the 4506T 4 more times, so we sent them at least 8 to make sure. So that didn't \\\"make sense\\\", nor did their inability to accept the IRS transcripts sent from the IRS, nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in Dallas over Christmas.

That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years.

Based on broker feedback that the transaction was in underwriting on July 23rd, we planned the closing date on our new home purchase for 1 month later and I alerted VA.

One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds. Another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in December just a month later during the time NASB intended to sell the mortgage. Thankfully this was corrected by the Closing Agent.\\r\\n3. Mr. Owens not being straight with us about NASB's intent to sell the mortgage after closing. His statements of first saying NASB would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the Loan Estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there \\\"just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future.\\\" Since today, just 5 days after disbursement, I find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows Mr. Owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn't definite. \\r\\n4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial Closing Document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior to arrival at the Closing Agent's place of business.\\r\\nPros allow for the Neutral instead of bad rating because the \\\"despites\\\" show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable.\\r\\n...

So that didn't \"make sense\", nor did their inability to accept the IRS transcripts sent from the IRS, nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in Dallas over Christmas.

I basically said that their response was not acceptable; and we eventually got it done. However, I would never recommend them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing I would give them high points for is responsiveness. At least until I agreed to go with them, they got back to me quicker than anyone. I didn't go with 2 other lenders who were offering similar rates because they weren't getting back to me as fast as Gauranteed Rate. Once I went with them, however, the process dragged on for months; and they almost weren't going to give me the loan. Buyers Beware... Read More\\r\\n                                 \n",
